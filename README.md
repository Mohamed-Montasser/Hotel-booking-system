  - Responsive GUI updates

- **GUI with JavaFX**
  - Responsive TableView
  - Separate Admin and Customer views
  - Center-aligned columns

## 💡 OOP Concepts Used

- **Inheritance & Polymorphism**
  - Room subclasses: `SingleRoom`, `DoubleRoom`, `Suite`
  - User subclasses: `Admin`, `Customer`

- **Interfaces**
  - `Filterable<T>` for generic filtering

- **Custom Exceptions**
  - `InvalidBookingException` for invalid booking operations

---

## 🛠 Technologies

- Java 17+
- JavaFX
- MVC structure
- NetBeans or IntelliJ recommended
